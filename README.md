# the-German-school-system

View live project [here](https://lujoh.github.io/the-German-school-system/)

This was the first proper website I made for my Intro to Web Technologies Class after less than six weeks of learning any Web Development. Please consider my lack of experience at the time when looking at the website. I have included it here, because it is a nice example of one of my early projects and because I am passionate about the topic shown on the website.

The website explains the general structure of the German school system and mentions some of the problems that are present in the system.
